# Fun in the Blanks

A personalized children's story book made with AngularJS, HTML, CSS, JSON, and firebase. A children's mad libs style story where the child can take part in classic fairy tales.
Goal is to teach a child to spell their name and some common words.
<P>
I picked a color scheme from a LEGO focused site to find child friendly colors, then muted the colors for easier screen readablity. The large inputs and large font size allow the child to see their name on screen.



<P>To play, open up any chapter. Ask the child for requested information in the prompts. Have the child enter their response or you can enter it for them. Have the child spell the word with you. Tap the TAB key to go to the next blank., repeat untill all the blanks are filled. Once the form is filled out, click the *"Build Your Story" button*. The game will then take your words and put them into the story.
Since the story is hidden until the button is clicked you can play alone.
<P>Read the story with the child, repeat.</p>

<B>Languages:</b> HTML, CSS, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Firebase, and JSON


##Future Plans

Eventually more stories will be added.
Stories will made to match child's reading level.
